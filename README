This program is simply for me to learn how to work with
binary trees in C++, in the form of Huffman coding.

The goal i decided to go for was: A console based application
that will read a file, perform huffman coding, then save the
result in one data file, and one huffman tabel file. So that
the data can be stored, sent, or maybe used in some other
context.
